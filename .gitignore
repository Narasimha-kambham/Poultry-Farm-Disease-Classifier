# If you want to add *.keras back AFTER it's committed with LFS as a safety net,
# you can do so, but for now, it's removed to resolve the 'ignored' error during 'git add'.

# IMPORTANT NOTE regarding 'src/*':
# This line will ignore ALL contents within the 'src' folder.
# If your 'src' folder contains core Python source code that you want to track
# (e.g., Python modules, utility scripts), then you should DELETE or COMMENT OUT this line.
# It is typically used if 'src' is for generated build outputs or similar.
# If 'src' contains your actual source code, remove this line.
